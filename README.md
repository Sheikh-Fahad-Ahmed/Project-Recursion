# Project-Recursion

This project is about practicing recursion.
For this i have picked two recursion type problems
 
- Fibonacci 
- Merge Sort

## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence that can be used in programming to explore recursion and iterative solutions, and to introduce fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.

In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
